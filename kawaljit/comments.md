### Homework Comments
- You have just one thing missing from your homework! Add a 768px breakpoint by adding the following:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  main {
    /* css styling at this breakpoint */
  }
}
```

- Add hover effects to links by adding pseudo-classes, for example:

```css
a:hover {
  color: blue;
}
```

Good effort Kawaljit!
