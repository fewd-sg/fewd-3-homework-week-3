### Homework Comments
- You might want to make use of a CSS reset file so that your website looks consistent across browsers, and also to remove the padding around your layout.

- Instead of having a percentage width on your **Sign up now** button, you can try using padding to give it size. Make use of padding shorthand for that: `padding: 10px 30px;`

- Experiment using `float: right` on the nav instead of using margin to position it.

- Alternative to wrapping your `a` tag with a `p` tag: http://codepen.io/calvintan/pen/KgwpGY

- Apply either `clear: both` or add the `.clearfix` class on your **banner**, so you won't need to use the empty **break** div.

Nice work Sarena!
