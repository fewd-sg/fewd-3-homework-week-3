### Homework Comments
- I think we rectified a couple of things in class, adding the css reset file, fixing the broken link for the image, and switching from fixed with to percentage width for a responsive layout.

- Just 2 additional points missing from your homework. Add hover effects to links by adding pseudo-classes, for example:

```css
a:hover {
  color: blue;
}
```

- You can also add drop caps using pseudo-classes, by adding `p:first-letter` to your CSS instead of wrapping a `span`.
