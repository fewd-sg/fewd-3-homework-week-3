### Homework Comments
- Awesome that you experimented with different breakpoints for the layout!
- You can opt to remove the margin on your `header h1` and `nav` elements at 768px breakpoint, and set padding on the `header` instead. 
- Also noticed that you used jQuery for the link as well. One minor improvement is that you can store the same string as a variable ;)

Great work Vincent!
