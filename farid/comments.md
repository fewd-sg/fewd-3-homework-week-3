### Homework Comments
- Love the updated dummy text dude!
- I'm also guessing you cropped the **ad-unit** image for the responsive layout? You have to set it's width to 100% at smaller breakpoints ;)
- You can center the `main` when reponsive by adding the `margin: 0 auto` to the css
- You may want to think about how to center the menu when responsive instead of just hiding it

Nice work man!
